# MISCO

Please properly install the simulation environment EvoGym by following the instructions at https://evolutiongym.github.io/, and then place the folders in this repository under "/examples".  

Our main algorithm program is in "MISCO_A.py" and "MISCO_B.py".

The architecture definition file of probabilistic generation model MEC-VAE is under folder path 'codes_of_model_architecture/'. 

When running the algorithm code file, you need to download and place the corresponding model framework definition file in the same path as the algorithm code.

The 'py' file with the 'Abalation' prefix is the algorithm code for the ablation experiments.

Please feel free to contact us if you run into any problem.
