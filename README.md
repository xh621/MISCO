Please properly install the simulation environment EvoGym by following the instructions at https://evolutiongym.github.io/, and then place the folders in this repository under "/examples".  

Our main algorithm program is in "MISCO_A.py" and "MISCO_B.py" and the architecture definition of probabilistic generation model MEC-VAE is in folder path 'codes_of_model_architecture/'. ANd the 'py' file with the 'Abalation' prefix is the algorithm code for the ablation experiments.
