  <em>Figure 1: Algorithm Overview. a, In each generation, MISCO iterates over four stages: (1) Robot proposal by MEC-VAE to generate candidate solutions; (2) Control optimization and fitness evaluation; (3) Natural selection with an adjustable balance between advantage exploitation and biodiversity exploration; (4) Model update based on the selected robot designs to better fit the high-performing morphology distribution. The algorithm then returns to the first stage, and generates a new, hopefully better, population from the shifted distribution. b, The process of robot proposal by MEC-VAE. c, The detail of model update. Given a specific robot morphology and its task type, the approximate posterior (i.e. encoder) infers the latent variable H_t, which is then used to reconstruct a morphological distribution. The evidence lower bound (ELBO) consists of two terms, the reconstruction error and the KL divergence regularizing the approximate posterior towards the prior distribution.</em>

## üìñ Project Overview

Motivated by the aforementioned limitations, here we propose MISCO, **a novel evolutionary framework that leverages the multi-task optimization capabilities enabled by deep GM-based EDAs for robot design automation**. Specifically, we integrate the **Morphological Evolutionary Conditional Variational Autoencoder** (MEC-VAE), a probabilistic generative model designed specifically for modeling voxel-based soft robots, into a bi-level optimization algorithm.

### Key Features
- ü§ñ Automated design of voxel-based soft robots
- üß† Morphology-control co-optimization
- üîÑ Multi-task knowledge sharing and transfer
- üìä Adjustable exploration-exploitation balance strategy

## üåü Technical Innovations

### MEC-VAE Architecture

MEC-VAE introduces three key innovations:
1. Task-aware mechanism
2. Position-aware encoding
3. Inter-module coordination system (based on neural cellular automata)

### Algorithm Variants
- **MISCO-A**: Exploitation-focused variant for optimization efficiency
- **MISCO-B**: Exploration-focused variant for morphological diversity

## üìà Benchmark Tasks

This project includes 8 benchmark tasks:
- Jumper-v0: Jumping task
- Climber-v0: Climbing task
- Carrier-v0: Carrying task
- DownStepper-v0: Down-stepping task
- PlatformJumper-v0: Platform jumping task
- Flipper-v0: Flipping task
- Thrower-v0: Throwing task
- Catcher-v0: Catching task

Here we provide a simple introduction to the task settings accompanied by illustrative images of each task. For readers seeking a deeper understanding of the physical setup and configurations, we recommend referring to Evolution Gym simulation environment.

## üî¨ Evaluation Metrics

### Optimization Efficiency
- **Best Fitness**: Evaluates the optimal solution found by the algorithm
- **Fitness Distribution**: Reflects the overall optimization quality
- **Cumulative Fitness Time Average (CFTA)**: Reflects the algorithm's ability to explore and maintain high-performance morphology designs

### Morphological Diversity
Evaluated using **Morphological Diversity Score (MDS)**:
- MDS = Œ± MV + Œ≤ MHD, 
where MV is morphological variance, MHD is morphological Hamming distance, Œ± and Œ≤ are weight coefficients, typically set to 0.5.

### Diversity Analysis

  <br>
  <em>Figure 4: Performance comparison of diversity. In some cases such as GA in Climber-v0, the algorithm fails to produce more than one robot design that could enter top 5 percent and so diversity is not available ("NA"). Revisit the results in Section efficiency, and we note that only MEC-VAE and MorphVAE are able to achieve diversity steadily on most tasks without compromising the ability to evolve high-performing robots. This confirms the superiority of probabilistic generative models, such as VAE, to infer statistical distributions of high-performing solutions from evaluated sample points, hence effectively stimulating the exploration of diverse promising designs in the evolutionary process and achieving a delicate balance between exploration and exploitation.</em>

### Conclusions
Experiments across 8 benchmark tasks demonstrate that:
- MISCO-A achieves the best performance in 5 tasks with highest maximum fitness, while maintaining strong and competitive optimization efficiency across all 8 tasks
- MISCO-B provides higher morphological diversity while maintaining competitive performance
- Significant improvements in both optimization efficiency and morphological diversity compared to existing methods
